# Categorizing Wine Quality

We used data exploring the quality and physicochemical characteristics of Portuguese Vinho Verde wine. The data comes from a paper published by Cortez, et al. in Decision Support Systems in 2009. This data was developed for the purpose of predicting the quality of the wine based on its physicochemical characteristics.
