# Categorizing Wine Quality

We used data exploring the quality and physicochemical characteristics of Portuguese Vinho Verde wine to predict the quality of wines. The data comes from a paper published by Cortez, et al. in Decision Support Systems in 2009. This data was developed for the purpose of predicting the quality of the wine based on its physicochemical characteristics.

Below is a brief description of these features / physicochemical characteristics:

* quality - score between 0 (worst) to 10 (best) based on blind taste tests

* wine - type of wine, either white or red

* fixed_acidity - grams of tartaric acid / dm^3

* volatile_acidity - grams of acetic acid / dm^3

* citric_acid - grams of citric acid / dm^3

* residual_sugar - grams / dm^3

* chlorides - grams of sodium chloride / dm^3

* free_sulfur_dioxide - milligram / dm^3

* total_sulfur_dioxide - milligram / dm^3

* density - g / cm^3

* pH - acidity

* sulphates - grams of potassium sulphate

* alcohol - percent alcohol by volume
